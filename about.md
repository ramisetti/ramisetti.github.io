I am Srinivasa Ramisetti, a research fellow at the University of Leeds (UoL). In my current role, I lead the multiscale modelling and simulation group, co-supervise 2 PHDâ€™s working on molecular and multiscale simulations of enhanced oil recovery problems, and provide research support on numerical simulations to 2-3 other experimental researchers.

Previously I worked as a research associate at the University of Edinburgh, where I was involved in molecular simulations of liquid slip over carbon nanotube coatings and software development of multiscale codes for micro/nano fluid problems. I recieved my Ph.D in Structures from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne in 2013. Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer at AutoForm Engineering India Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad.
