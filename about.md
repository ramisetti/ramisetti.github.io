I am Srinivasa Ramisetti working as a Principal Scientist in the Theoretical and Computational Mechanics Laboratory at CSIR - Structural Engineering Research Centre, Chennai, India. Before moving to SERC, I worked as a research fellow at University of Exeter, UK (2019) and at the University of Leeds, UK (2017-2019) where I worked on molecular and multiscale simulations of enhanced oil recovery problems. Previously I worked as a research associate at the University of Edinburgh, UK (2014-2017) where I was involved in molecular simulations of liquid slip over carbon nanotube coatings and software development of multiscale codes for micro/nano fluid problems. I recieved my Ph.D in Structures from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne in 2013. Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer at AutoForm Engineering India Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad.

Here, I will primarily be sharing material related to my research and other notes related to opensource code for future reference. Hope this material may be helpful to others as well.
